This Laravel package simplifies the implementation of single sign-on authentication. It features a centralized user repository and enables the creation of user models in brokers without disrupting app logic. Additionally, it provides methods for incorporating authentication history pages and terminating sessions for either all users or specific ones with ease

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation for this package is currently being written. For now, please refer to this readme for information on the functionality and usage of the package.

Run migrations:

Register the middleware:


<details>
  <summary>Laravel 12 and newer</summary>
  <p>In Laravel 12, middleware is registered in `bootstrap/app.php` using the `withMiddleware` method.</p>

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',
        // ...
    )
    ->withMiddleware(static function (Middleware $middleware): void {
        // Prepend session start and broker attach to the 'web' group
        $middleware->web(prepend: [
            \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
            \Jurager\Passport\Http\Middleware\AttachBroker::class
        ]);

        // Replace the default auth alias with package's version
        $middleware->alias([
            'auth' => \Jurager\Passport\Http\Middleware\ClientAuthenticate::class,
        ]);
    })
    ->withExceptions(function ($exceptions) {
        // ...
    });
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Laravel 11 and earlier</summary>
  <p>If your application still uses the classic HTTP kernel `app/Http/Kernel.php`, register middleware there.</p>

Add middleware to the `web` group:

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
        \Jurager\Passport\Http\Middleware\AttachBroker::class,
        // ...
     
    ],
];
```
   
Replace the `auth` middleware alias with the package's version:

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'auth' => \Jurager\Passport\Http\Middleware\ClientAuthenticate::class,
    // ...
];
```
</details>
